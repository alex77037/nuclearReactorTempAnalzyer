**Task:**
Solve the problem using collections, List, ArrayList.

1) The user continuously inputs numbers into the program - the temperature of the nuclear reactor.
2) After EACH input, provide the user with the following information:
2.1) The average temperature of the nuclear reactor over ALL time.
2.2) How the current input temperature differs from the previous one.
2.3) If the input temperature exceeds the average by 10% and
has increased compared to the previous value by more than 20%,
display a message on the screen "Warning, temperature exceeded".

**Advanced task:**

3.1) Also, calculate the average temperature for the last 10 measurements and
the average temperature of every 100th measurement.
